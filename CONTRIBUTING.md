# Contributing to Orbis

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Orbis! We welcome all contributions, big or small. Please read the following guidelines to help us maintain a high standard for the project.

## Getting Started
- Fork the repository and create your branch from `main`.
- Follow the existing code style and conventions.
- Make sure your code builds and passes all tests.
- If you are submitting a bug fix, please include steps to reproduce the issue.

## Pull Requests
- Ensure your pull request (PR) is linked to an existing issue. If none exists, please [open an issue](https://github.com/EmpireWar/Orbis/issues/new/choose) first.
- Describe the purpose of your PR and what it changes.
- If your PR adds a new feature or flag, provide documentation and usage examples.
- Keep PRs focused and avoid including unrelated changes.

## Adding New Flags
- **Cross-Platform:** New flags should ideally work on all supported platforms (Paper, Fabric, NeoForge, Sponge).
  - If you don't know how to implement a flag on a platform, comment on the open issue so that we can help you.
- **Issue Required:** There should be an existing GitHub issue for the flag. Please link your PR to this issue.
- **Documentation:** Document the flag clearly, including its purpose, usage, and any platform-specific notes.

## Code Style
- Follow the formatting and naming conventions used in the codebase.
- The `spotlessApply` task can be used to format your code - this automatically runs on `build`.
- Write clear commit messages and reference relevant issues.
- Use descriptive variable and method names.
- Add comments where necessary to explain complex logic.

## Reporting Issues
- Use the [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/EmpireWar/Orbis/issues) to report bugs or request features.
- Provide as much detail as possible, including logs, screenshots, and steps to reproduce.

## Community
